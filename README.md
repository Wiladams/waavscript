This is an implementation of a Postscript interpreter written in C++.  This project was inspired by another Postscript interpreter that was written in Lua: https://github.com/Wiladams/lj2ps

The backend for the graphics rendering uses the blend2d library.

The list of operators involved in the Postscript language is long.  The list of currently implemented operators can be found here: https://github.com/Wiladams/waavscript/blob/main/docs/registryofops.md
